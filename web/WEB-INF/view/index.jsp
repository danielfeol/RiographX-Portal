    <p>Computers have been, definitely, used for many graph theorists as a tool for describe classes of graphs that satisfies some constraints and/or optimizes a given function.</p>

    <p>RioGraphX is a science gateway published as a Web application
    to aid Spectral Graph Theory researchers either in the investigation of counterexamples for an
    existing conjecture or in describing classes of graphs that optimize a given function under
    some possible constraints. </p>

    <p>The aim is to run experiments in order to find extremal graphs for a specified objective function given as an input. The idea is to generate all graphs satisfying some constraints and from that get the top graphs corresponding the optimization of a given objective function. Those graphs are displayed in a PDF file.</p>
